Idea is that each molecule ID in each aggregate is recorded so that we can say
if monomers are stacking, or if covalent dimers are stacking, or monomers with
dimers.

Should probably also take it further and split the dimer into two, so that each
π system is considered separately, then we can see if each π system interacts
with a monomer, or a dimer?

Should we consider each atom when it comes to determining number of aggregates,
or the centre of mass of each π system? Then when it comes to the angles, need
to specify a way to describe the plane between the carbonyls/hydroxyls and the
C2 carbon next to the nitrogen for each individual π system - for the dimer
maybe we can just use one plane?
